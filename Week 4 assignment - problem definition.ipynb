Next step is to find the coordinates for each one of them using [geopy](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/) library in python. Then we can utilize Foursquare to find coordinates of the top 10 beaches in each island. Next, we can find the top venues for each beach and lastly we can cluster our findings and hopefully draw useful conclusion and insight for our stakeholder. Example of the Foursquare dataset you can see below:",
